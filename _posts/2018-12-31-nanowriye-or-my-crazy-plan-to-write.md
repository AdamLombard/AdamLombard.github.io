I completed my first [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.com) this year and really enjoyed the experience. So much, in fact, that I’ve decided to completely overdo it and ruin the whole thing by keeping up a near-to-NaNoWriMo pace for an entire year. A #NaNoWriYe, if you will.

For a preternaturally slow writer like myself this is clearly a terrible idea. And, like all terrible ideas, it deserves bullet points:

- My official goal is to write 500,000 words in one year. This feels more realistic and achievable than a true NaNoWriMo pace of 1,677 words per day, which would equal 612,105 words in a year. Plus, it just feels cool to say "a half-million words in one year".

- I plan to fully participate in NaNoWriMo 2019, so 50,000 of my 500,000 words will be written that month.

- This leaves 450,000 words to write in 11 months, or an average of 1,344 each day.

- This daily quota is a target, not a rule. I write a lot more on the weekend than during the work week, and if I skip a day here or there because of life, no big deal. It's the average over the long term that matters.

- Any creative writing outside my day job will count toward my total. I’ll be focused on the sequel to [Manly Hero](https://www.manlyhero.com), but other prose, poems, or blog posts count. My ultimate objective is simply to spend more time on the page.
