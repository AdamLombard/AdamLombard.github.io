A few weeks ago, [@isaacandsuch](https://dev.to/isaacandsuch) posted a great article about [hiring junior developers](https://dev.to/isaacandsuch/if-you-dont-hire-juniors-you-dont-deserve-seniors-48kb).

The article got me thinking about how _extra_ hard it is for junior developers to find remote work. So I started a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AdamLombard/we-hire-remote-junior-devs) listing companies that hire junior developers for remote positions.

If you know of such a company, please submit a pull request (or message me directly) and I'd be happy to add it to the list!
